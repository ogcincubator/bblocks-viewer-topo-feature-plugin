// Canonical type-only reference for bblocks-viewer's view-plugin contract — the interface a
// register-declared or first-party plugin class must satisfy, and the shape of the `context`
// object bblocks-viewer always constructs and passes to it. bblocks-viewer itself is the runtime
// authority (see its src/composables/view-plugins.js for matching/context-construction and
// src/utils/dependency-resolver.js for the DependencyResolver implementation); this repo exists
// only so that authority's type contract can be depended on without pulling in the entire app.
//
// Consumers add this package as a devDependency (types only, never a runtime dependency — a
// plugin has no runtime dependency on bblocks-viewer or on this package) via
// `"@ogc/bblocks-viewer-plugin-types": "github:ogcincubator/bblocks-viewer-plugin-types"`, then
// `import type { ... } from '@ogc/bblocks-viewer-plugin-types'` (TypeScript) or
// `@implements {import('@ogc/bblocks-viewer-plugin-types').ViewPluginClass}` (JSDoc, for plain JS
// plugins). Do not keep a local duplicate of this file — bblocks-viewer-base-plugins,
// bblocks-viewer-topo-feature-plugin, and bblocks-view-plugin-starter all depend on this single
// copy so the contract can change in one place.
