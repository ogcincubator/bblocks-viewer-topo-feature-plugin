// bespoke branches in the renderer — so that Stage 2 (a per-block config) can override or extend
// exactly what a document renders by default without the renderer's classification logic
// changing. Deliberately has no import of topo-geometry.js or Three.js: every fact this needs
// about a document (how many solids/open shells/parcels/faces/rings it has, and what opacity each
// tier should use) is passed in by the caller, which already computes them for geometry-building
// regardless — this keeps the branch decision itself pure and unit-testable on its own.

// parcel rule is included even with a zero count for that source — matching every renderable's
// worth of the original's unconditional `openShells.forEach`/`parcels.forEach`, which is simply a
// no-op over an empty array). Only when none of the three is present does a single-tier fallback
// (faces, else rings) apply. Bare edges/points have no per-feature kind or label to configure and
// stay outside the rule engine entirely — the renderer draws them directly.
