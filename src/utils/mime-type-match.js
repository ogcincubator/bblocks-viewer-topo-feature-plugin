// Wildcard-aware MIME type matcher. Kept as a local copy (not a shared dependency) since this
// package has no runtime dependency on bblocks-viewer or bblocks-viewer-base-plugins — each
// plugin package is standalone. Must stay behaviorally identical to bblocks-viewer's
// src/utils/mime-type-match.js, which the host uses to match `static supportedTypes` before ever
// instantiating a plugin; this copy is only used internally by the plugin's own matches() to pick
// which candidate(s) it actually wants to render.
